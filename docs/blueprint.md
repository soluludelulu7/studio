## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Green (#8FBC8F) to reflect learning, growth, and accessibility, avoiding the cliche of coding/tech apps needing to be teal/blue. It brings to mind a chalk board.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), of the same hue as green but very desaturated, to ensure a clean and distraction-free learning environment, especially for underprivileged communities with limited resources.
- Accent color: Soft Orange (#E9967A) for badges and important calls to action, ensuring good contrast.
- Clean and spacious layout with ample whitespace to enhance readability, optimizing the app for simple UI with minimal colors and large fonts.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' for a modern and readable feel. Suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use simple, outlined icons to represent lessons, achievements, and other features.
- Subtle animations for lesson transitions and rewards to give positive feedback to the student.
